## Usage

Make the component available to authors using standard magnolia techniques.

(To make this component available on the mtk basic page, you could use the decoration included in `_dev/decorations`.)

This component requires Magnolia version 5.5.0 or greater, because it uses the navfn templating functions.

## Demo

To see a page demonstrating this component, open the Pages app in Magnolia AdminCentral and import the files in `_dev/demos`.

## Information on Magnolia CMS

Search the docs for `sharing light modules` for details on how to share and use light modules on npm and github.


## Contribute to the Magnolia component ecosystem
It's easy to create components for Magnolia and share them on github and npm. I invite you to do so and join the community. Let's stop wasting time by developing the same thing again and again, rather let's help each other out by sharing our work and create a rich library of components.

Just add `magnolia-light-module` as a keyword to npm's package.json to make them easy to find and use on npm.
